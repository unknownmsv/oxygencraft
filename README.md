cd o2craft
(Don't forget to replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!)Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:Create a requirements.txt file with the content provided here and then run:pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the ApplicationYou can run the server in two modes:1. Development Mode (for testing)This uses Flask's built-in development server. It's easy to use but not suitable for a live environment.python app.py
2. Production Mode (Recommended)This uses Gunicorn with gevent workers, which is the correct way to run the application to handle WebSockets and concurrent users efficiently.gunicorn --worker-class gevent -w 1 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
--worker-class gevent: Essential for WebSocket support.-w 1: Runs a single worker process. You can increase this if needed, but for a personal manager, 1 is usually enough.--bind 0.0.0.0:8000: Makes the server accessible on your local network at port 8000.Once running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 or http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000.📖 How to UseOpen the Web Interface: Navigate to the application in your browser.Create a Server:Click the + Create New Server button.Fill in the server name, select the type (Java/Bedrock), choose a version, and allocate RAM.Click Create Server. A status modal will show the download and setup progress.Manage a Server:From the dashboard, click Manage → on the server you want to control.On the management page, you can:Start, Stop, or Restart the server.View the Live Console.Edit settings in the Server Properties panel and save them. (Remember to restart the server for property changes to take effect!)📁 Project Structureo2craft/
